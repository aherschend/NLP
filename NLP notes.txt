NLP = Natural Language Processing
Someone developed a NLP tool kit that has an algorithm that trains their model over and over
Analyze comments and figure out if it is a positive or negative comments

Pretty cutting - edge, people are still developing these kind of things 

Some of the work has already been done, it can sense context 

Repetition is helpful, the more we can throw at it the better it learns

TextBlob
- object oriented NLP text-processing library
- built on the NLTK ( natural language tool kit) and pattern NLP libraries
    - tokenization - splitting text into pieces called tokens, which are meaningful units, such as words and numbers
    - parts of speech (POS) tagging
    - noun phrase extraction
    - sentiment analysis
    - inter-language translation and language detection
        - actually uses Google Translate to put it into a different language
    - inflection - pluralizing and singularizing words
    - word frequencies - determinging how often each word appears in a corpus
